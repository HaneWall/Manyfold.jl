## Manifold Learning Package in Julia

Yet another manifold learning package in Julia. In this package 
we for now focus on nonlinear methods specifically the Diffusion Maps algorithm.

## Implemented Diffusion Map Methods
- Nystr√∂m extension for restriction for out of sample data
- k-nearest neighbor method for lifting (using NearestNeighbor.jl) from latent space 
to ambient space 
- Geometric Harmonics for lifting as well as restriction
