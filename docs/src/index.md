Documentation for `Manyfold.jl`.

## Manifold Learning Package in Julia
Another manifold learning package in Julia. In this package 
we for now focus on nonlinear methods specifically the Diffusion Maps algorithm.
Might add other nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods in future versions to justify "Many"fold.

## Statement of Need:
1. missing / not working / wrong Diffusion Map algorithm in (no longer maintained?) ManifoldLearning.jl
2. first Julia Package to implement out of sample methods to map between Diffusion Map Coordinates and Ambient Space
3. provides lifting and restriction formalism to equation free methods with Diffusion Maps

## Implemented Diffusion Map Methods
- Nystr√∂m extension for restriction for out of sample data
- k-nearest neighbor method for lifting (using NearestNeighbor.jl) from latent space 
to ambient space 
- (Multi Scale) Geometric Harmonics for lifting and restriction

## Acknowledgements
- package is inspired by ManifoldLearning.jl and Datafold (wonderful Python package)
